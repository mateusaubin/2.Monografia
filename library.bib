	p15
	
	
	The term "remote monitor" refers to a device on a LAN that observes all of 
	the traffic on the LAN and gathers information about that traffic. For 
	example, the total number of packets issued by an eleent on a LAN could be 
	recorded by the element itself or by a remote monitor that is listening on 
	the same LAN. Some dynamic information, however, can be generated only by 
	the element itself, such as the current number of network-level 
	connections.
	p24 c2
	
	
	Network monitoring is the most fundamental aspect of automated network 
	management. Although many network management systems---because of a lack 
	of security mechanisms---do not include network control features, all 
	network management systems include a network-monitoring component.
	The purpose of network monitoring is to gather information about the 
	status and beahvior of network elements. Information to be gathered 
	includes static information, related to the configuration; dynamic 
	information, related to events in the network; and statistical 
	information, summarized from dynamic information. Typically, each managed 
	device in the network includes an agent module responsible for collecting 
	local management information and transmitting it to one of more management 
	stations. Each management statio include network management application 
	software plus software for communicating with agents. Information may be 
	collected actively, by means of poolling by the management station, or 
	passively, by means of event reporting by the agents.
	p45 c2
	
	
	The network control portion of network management is concerned with 
	modifying parameters in and causing acions to be taken by the end systems, 
	intermediate systems, and subnetworks that make up the configuration to be 
	managed.
	p55 c3
	
	
	
	Network control is concerned with altering parameters of various 
	components of the configuration and causing predefined actions to be

	In early 1988 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) reviwed these

	The number of hosts attached to the Internet has grown explosively. This 
	growth in sheer size has been accompanied by a growth in complexity.
	p73 c4
	
	
	With the SNMP developers freed from the constraint of OSI compatibility, 
	progress was rapid and it mirrors the history of TCP/IP. SNMP soon became 
	widely available on vendor equipment and flourished within the Internet. 
	In addition, SNMP quickly became the standardized management protocol of 
	choice for the general user.
	p74 c4
	
	
	The Simple Network Management Protocol was designed to be an easily 
	implemented, basic network management tool that could be used to meet 
	short-term network management needs. Because of the slow progress in OSI 
	systems management, SNMP has filled the gap and become the dominant 
	standardized network management scheme in use today.
	p83 c4
	
	
	One of the strengths of the SNMP approach is the way in which the MIB has 
	been designed to accommodate growth and to provide flexibility for adding 
	new objects. As was mentioned, private extensions can be added to the 
	private subtree. This allows vendors to create objects to manage specific 
	entities on their products and to make those objects visible to a 
	management station. Because of the use of a standardized SMI and a 
	standardized object identifier scheme, it should be possible to manage 
	private objects from a management station of a different vendor. In other 
	words, interoperability should extend to private extensions to the MIB.

	the results are discouraging to the customer/user who believes the 
	"simple" in "SNMP".
	p111 c5
	
	
	Only weak control objects were permitted (by "weak" it is meant that 
	tampering with them can do only limited damage). This criterion reflects 
	the fact that the current management protocols are not sufficiently secure

	The genisis of SNMP-based management is the Internet Engineering Task 
	Force (IETF), an open organization to create standards for the Internet. 
	The initial targets for this effort were TCP/IP routers (also called 
	gateways) and hosts (i.e, computer systems). However, then SNMP-based 
	management approach is inherently generic so that it can be used to manage 
	many types of systems. This approach can be used with computer data 
	networks, automotive traffic networks, heating and cooling control 
	networks, irrigation networks, or chemical plants. Thus you can see that 
	almos any real0time system consisting of a collection of independent 
	communicating elements can use SNMP.
	p2
	
	
	The addition of external (or remote) management must add value to the 
	system for it to be useful.
	p154 c5
	
	
	
	Monolithic and Extensible Agent Structure
	
	There are two predominate approaches that have been used to implement 
	agents. In small dedicated (and closed) systems a monolithic approach is 
	typically used. This is the approach where the agent, method routines, and 
	muuch of the instrumentation is combined together. This is a good choice 
	when all the software sub-systems are known and combined together at agent 
	(and typically system) compile and/or link time. In general purpose (and 
	open) systems an extensible approach is typically used. This approach 
	keeps separate an agent and method routines. This approach delays linkage 
	of the agent and method routines until load time, initialization time, or 
	run time. This is more complex and can be slightly slower in performance 
	and larger in size than a monolithic approach. However, an extensible 
	approach is preferred for multi-processor systems, and those systems that 
	support dynamic addition and removal of managed software sub0systems, such 
	as open and general purpose systems.
	For a simple dedicated managed system, tere may be one executable code 
	image that contains a small real-time operating system kernel, an agent, a 
	transport stack, services, and functions. In this case, there may be no 
	visible separation and interfaces between each sub-system. This monolithic 
	system is typically built and integrated by one engineer. A more complex 
	dedicated system typically requires several engineers to work together to 
	design and integrate it. There tends to be blearer lines of separation and 
	well0defined interfaces in these systems. Even in this environment, a 
	monolithic agent may still be used. Coordination between the engineers is 
	required to create the system executable code image.
	[...]
	In sumarry, monolithic and extensible agents are two different approaches 
	to implementing SNMP-based management of a system. An SNMP manager should 
	not be able to determine how an SNMP agent has been implemented. No matter 
	what the implementation strategy, a manager should see one agent per 
	managed system and the same management information. These requirements can 
	be met in dedicated (and closed) systems, but are quite difficult and 
	currently economically infeasible in general purpose (and open) systems.

@article{Herberg2010,
	abstract = {Mobile Ad Hoc NETworks (MANETs) are generally thought of as 
	infrastructureless and largely â€œun-managedâ€ network deployments, 
	capable of accommodating highly dynamic network topologies. Yet, while the 
	network infrastructure may be â€œun-managedâ€, monitoring the network 
	performance and setting configuration parameters once deployed, remains 
	important in order to ensure proper â€œtuningâ€ and maintenance of a 
	MANET. This paper describes a management framework for the MANET routing 
	protocol OLSRv2, and its constituent protocol NHDP. It does so by 
	presenting considerations for â€œwhat to monitor and manageâ€ in an 
	OLSRv2 network, and how. The approach developed is based on the Simple 
	Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and thus this paper details the 
	various Management Information Bases (MIBs) for router status monitoring 
	and control - as well as a novel approach to history-based performance 
	monitoring. While SNMP may not be optimally designed for MANETs, it is 
	chosen due to it being the predominant protocol for IP network management 
	- and thus, efforts are made in this paper to â€œadaptâ€ the management 
	tools within the SNMP framework for reasonable behavior also in a MANET

	communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and 
	dis- tributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. 
	As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the 
	Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities 
	conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecom- munications, 
	informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, 
	this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex

	Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies 
	reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the

	abstract = {The World Wide Web has enabled the creation of a global 
	information space comprising linked documents. As the Web becomes ever 
	more enmeshed with our daily lives, there is a growing desire for direct 
	access to raw data not currently available on the Web or bound up in 
	hypertext documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which 
	not only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the 
	Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data space 
	based on open standards - the Web of Data. In this Synthesis lecture we 
	provide readers with a detailed technical introduction to Linked Data. We 
	begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked Data, including coverage 
	of relevant aspects of Web architecture. The remainder of the text is 
	based around two main themes - the publication and consumption of Linked 
	Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data scenario, we provide guidance and 
	best practices on: architectural approaches to publishing Linked Data; 
	choosing URIs and vocabularies to identify and describe resources; 
	deciding what data to return in a description of a resource on the Web; 
	methods and frameworks for automated linking of data sets; and testing and 
	debugging approaches for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of 
	existing Linked Data applications and then examine the architectures that 
	are used to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and 
	frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical 
	understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application 
	development, research or further study.},

	concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques 
	that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their

	Semantic Web development. The book also examines such crucial related 
	topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios.
	
	After an introductory chapter, topics covered in succeeding chapters 
	include XML and related technologies that support semantic 
	interoperability; RDF and RDF Schema, the standard data model for 
	machine-processable semantics; and OWL, the W3C-approved standard for a 
	Web ontology language more extensive than RDF Schema; rules, both

@article{S2009,
	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are expected to be deployed widely in 
	various areas in coming years. The sensor device is small and has low 
	computation power and memory thus perceived as not suitable to be loaded 
	with the high resource IP capabilities. Due to this, the wireless sensor 
	network remains isolated from the Internet. The emergence of IPv6 over low 
	power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) has proved that IP 
	communication is borderless and can be used for any devices. It provides a 
	simple alternative to other wireless sensor networks and interoperable 
	with IP-legacy systems and tools. However, the use of short addresses 
	within the 6LoWPAN network is not visible to the outside world and hence a 
	proper gateway is required. In this paper, we provide the architecture of 
	the 6LoWPAN gateway which connects the wireless sensor world to the 
	Internet. Our contribution is to provide direct accessibility to wireless 
	sensor network using short address to full IPv6 address translation at the 
	gateway. Our main focus is the flow of packets to and from the gateway 
	including a simple address translation mechanism. The implementation and 
	the use cases of the gateway are also highlighted. Keywords: 6LoWPAN,

	informationâ€ proposed by Moore and Walsh (2002) and deduct specifics for 
	the Internet of Things. Building on this, we describe four exemplary 
	business model scenarios. These are visualised using the business model 
	framework by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2009). This framework, the

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IOT) concept and enabling technologies 
	such as RFID offer the prospect of linking the real world of physical 
	objects with the virtual world of information technology to improve 
	visibility and traceability information within supply chains and across 
	the entire lifecycles of products, as well as enabling more intuitive 
	interactions and greater automation possibilities. There is a huge 
	potential for savings through process optimization and profit generation 
	within the IOT, but the sharing of financial benefits across companies 
	remains an unsolved issue. Existing approaches towards sharing of costs 
	and benefits have failed to scale so far. The integration of payment 
	solutions into the IOT architecture could solve this problem. We have 
	reviewed different possible levels of integration. Multiple payment 
	solutions have been researched. Finally we have developed a model that 
	meets the requirements of the IOT in relation to openness and scalability. 
	It supports both hardware-centric and software-centric approaches to 
	integration of payment solutions with the IOT. Different requirements 
	concerning payment solutions within the IOT have been defined and 
	considered in the proposed model. Possible solution providers include 
	telcos, e-payment service providers and new players such as banks and 
	standardization bodies. The proposed model of integrating the Internet of 
	Things with payment solutions will lower the barrier to invoicing for the 
	more granular visibility information generated using the IOT. Thus, it has 
	the potential to enable recovery of the necessary investments in IOT 
	infrastructure and accelerate adoption of the IOT, especially for projects 
	that are only viable when multiple benefits throughout the supply chain 
	need to be accumulated in order to achieve a Return on Investment (ROI). 
	In a long-term perspective, it may enable IT-departments to become profit 
	centres instead of cost centres.},

	IPv6 â€˜Internet of Thingsâ€™, readers are offered an insight into how 
	these technologies fit together into a complete architecture. The 6LoWPAN 
	format and related standards are then covered in detail. In addition, the 
	authors discuss the building and operation of 6LoWPAN networks, including 
	bootstrapping, routing, security, Internet ingration, mobility and 
	application protocols. Furthermore, implementation aspects of 6LoWPAN are 
	covered.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are expected to be deployed widely in 
	various areas in coming years. The sensor device is small and has low 
	computation power and memory thus perceived as not suitable to be loaded 
	with the high resource IP capabilities. Due to this, the wireless sensor 
	network remains isolated from the Internet. The emergence of IPv6 over low 
	power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) has proved that IP 
	communication is borderless and can be used for any devices. It provides a 
	simple alternative to other wireless sensor networks and interoperable 
	with IP-legacy systems and tools. However, the use of short addresses 
	within the 6LoWPAN network is not visible to the outside world and hence a 
	proper gateway is required. In this paper, we provide the architecture of 
	the 6LoWPAN gateway which connects the wireless sensor world to the 
	Internet. Our contribution is to provide direct accessibility to wireless 
	sensor network using short address to full IPv6 address translation at the 
	gateway. Our main focus is the flow of packets to and from the gateway 
	including a simple address translation mechanism. The implementation and 
	the use cases of the gateway are also highlighted. Keywords: 6LoWPAN,

	abstract = {As organizations start to use data-intensive cluster computing 
	systems like Hadoop and Dryad for more applications, there is a growing 
	need to share clusters between users. However, there is a conflict between 
	fairness in scheduling and data locality (placing tasks on nodes that 
	contain their input data). We illustrate this problem through our 
	experience designing a fair scheduler for a 600-node Hadoop cluster at 
	Facebook. To address the conflict between locality and fairness, we 
	propose a simple algorithm called delay scheduling: when the job that 
	should be scheduled next according to fairness cannot launch a local task, 
	it waits for a small amount of time, letting other jobs launch tasks 
	instead. We find that delay scheduling achieves nearly optimal data 
	locality in a variety of workloads and can increase throughput by up to 2x 
	while preserving fairness. In addition, the simplicity of delay scheduling 
	makes it applicable under a wide variety of scheduling policies beyond 
	fair sharing.},
