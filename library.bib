The Mediacup project provides insights into the augmentation of artefacts with sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, and into the provision of an open infrastructure for information exchange among artefacts. One of the artefacts studied is the Mediacup itself, an ordinary coffee cup invisibly augmented with computing and context-awareness. The Mediacup and other computeraugmented everyday artefacts are connected through a network infrastructure supporting loosely-coupled spatially-defined communication.},

annote = {A complete network management system will include the capability of controlling a configuration as well as monitoring it.
p15
        
The term "remote monitor" refers to a device on a LAN that observes all of the traffic on the LAN and gathers information about that traffic. For example, the total number of packets issued by an eleent on a LAN could be recorded by the element itself or by a remote monitor that is listening on the same LAN. Some dynamic information, however, can be generated only by the element itself, such as the current number of network-level connections.
p24 c2
        
 Network monitoring is the most fundamental aspect of automated network management. Although many network management systems---because of a lack of security mechanisms---do not include network control features, all network management systems include a network-monitoring component.
 The purpose of network monitoring is to gather information about the status and beahvior of network elements. Information to be gathered includes static information, related to the configuration; dynamic information, related to events in the network; and statistical information, summarized from dynamic information. Typically, each managed device in the network includes an agent module responsible for collecting local management information and transmitting it to one of more management stations. Each management statio include network management application software plus software for communicating with agents. Information may be collected actively, by means of poolling by the management station, or passively, by means of event reporting by the agents.
p45 c2
        
The network control portion of network management is concerned with modifying parameters in and causing acions to be taken by the end systems, intermediate systems, and subnetworks that make up the configuration to be managed.
p55 c3
                  
Network control is concerned with altering parameters of various components of the configuration and causing predefined actions to be performed by these components.

CMIP over TCP/IP (CMOT)

In early 1988 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) reviwed these orioisaks abd aoorived further development of SNMP as a short-term solution and CMOT as the long0range solution (Cerf 1988).
p73 c4
        
The number of hosts attached to the Internet has grown explosively. This growth in sheer size has been accompanied by a growth in complexity.
p73 c4
        
With the SNMP developers freed from the constraint of OSI compatibility, progress was rapid and it mirrors the history of TCP/IP. SNMP soon became widely available on vendor equipment and flourished within the Internet. In addition, SNMP quickly became the standardized management protocol of choice for the general user.
p74 c4
        
The Simple Network Management Protocol was designed to be an easily implemented, basic network management tool that could be used to meet short-term network management needs. Because of the slow progress in OSI systems management, SNMP has filled the gap and become the dominant standardized network management scheme in use today.
p83 c4
        
One of the strengths of the SNMP approach is the way in which the MIB has been designed to accommodate growth and to provide flexibility for adding new objects. As was mentioned, private extensions can be added to the private subtree. This allows vendors to create objects to manage specific entities on their products and to make those objects visible to a management station. Because of the use of a standardized SMI and a standardized object identifier scheme, it should be possible to manage private objects from a management station of a different vendor. In other words, interoperability should extend to private extensions to the MIB.
p110 c5
        
the results are discouraging to the customer/user who believes the "simple" in "SNMP".
p111 c5
        
Only weak control objects were permitted (by "weak" it is meant that tampering with them can do only limited damage). This criterion reflects the fact that the current management protocols are not sufficiently secure to do more powerful control operations.

The San Raffaele Scientific Institute (HSR)’s eServices for Life and Health unit in Milan strives to explore and push the boundaries of the Smart City concept through the ideation and implementation of smart services. Often, these services achieve their highest potential through Internet of Things, which enable the constituents of these services (users, products, environments) to be interconnected. In order to examine the dynamics between users, service touchpoints and Internet of Things, HSR decided to develop a methodology within a Living Lab framework and set up the City of the Future Living Lab. The City of the Future Living Lab is both a virtual and real research environment and community and embodies a Smart City (indeed it contains a university, laboratories, a hospital, offices, shops, a supermarket, post-offices, streets, parks, a light rail train and bus service, numerous ICTs, etc.). It therefore has exposure to all users and consumers of a city. This paper focuses on delivering an overview of the Living Lab methodology and the way it brings together people, environments, ICT and Internet of Things in the creation of e- Services designed by and around the end user.

p1
        
The genisis of SNMP-based management is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open organization to create standards for the Internet. The initial targets for this effort were TCP/IP routers (also called gateways) and hosts (i.e, computer systems). However, then SNMP-based management approach is inherently generic so that it can be used to manage many types of systems. This approach can be used with computer data networks, automotive traffic networks, heating and cooling control networks, irrigation networks, or chemical plants. Thus you can see that almos any real0time system consisting of a collection of independent communicating elements can use SNMP.
p2
        
The addition of external (or remote) management must add value to the system for it to be useful.
p154 c5
        
        Monolithic and Extensible Agent Structure        
 There are two predominate approaches that have been used to implement agents. In small dedicated (and closed) systems a monolithic approach is typically used. This is the approach where the agent, method routines, and muuch of the instrumentation is combined together. This is a good choice when all the software sub-systems are known and combined together at agent (and typically system) compile and/or link time. In general purpose (and open) systems an extensible approach is typically used. This approach keeps separate an agent and method routines. This approach delays linkage of the agent and method routines until load time, initialization time, or run time. This is more complex and can be slightly slower in performance and larger in size than a monolithic approach. However, an extensible approach is preferred for multi-processor systems, and those systems that support dynamic addition and removal of managed software sub0systems, such as open and general purpose systems.
 For a simple dedicated managed system, tere may be one executable code image that contains a small real-time operating system kernel, an agent, a transport stack, services, and functions. In this case, there may be no visible separation and interfaces between each sub-system. This monolithic system is typically built and integrated by one engineer. A more complex dedicated system typically requires several engineers to work together to design and integrate it. There tends to be blearer lines of separation and well0defined interfaces in these systems. Even in this environment, a monolithic agent may still be used. Coordination between the engineers is required to create the system executable code image.
[...]
 In sumarry, monolithic and extensible agents are two different approaches to implementing SNMP-based management of a system. An SNMP manager should not be able to determine how an SNMP agent has been implemented. No matter what the implementation strategy, a manager should see one agent per managed system and the same management information. These requirements can be met in dedicated (and closed) systems, but are quite difficult and currently economically infeasible in general purpose (and open) systems.

abstract = {Exploring novel ubiquitous computing systems and applications inevitably requires prototyping physical components. Smart-Its are hardware and software components that augment physical objects with embedded processing and interaction to address this need. Our work, which uses small computing devices called Smart-Its, addresses the need to create embedded interactive systems that disappear from the foreground to become secondary to the physical objects with which people interact during everyday activities. Such systems create new design challenges related to prototyping with embedded technologies and require careful consideration of the physical design context.},

The paper concludes with a discussion of social and governance issues that are likely to arise as the vision of the Internet of Things becomes a reality.},
annote = {we are moving towards a system where (more or less) smart objects actually communicate with users, Internet services and even among each other.
        
as in conventional embedded systems, a
more extensive software infrastructure will be needed on the network and on
background servers in order to manage the smart objects and provide services
to support them.
        
The use of IP enables smart objects to use existing
Internet services and applications and, conversely, these smart objects can be addressed from anywhere since they are proper Internet participants.
        
Until recently, however, the prospect of full IP support for simple things appeared
illusory due to the resources required
Gateways would also generate added complexity, making installation, operation and mainte-nance time-consuming and costly.
        
2008, Atmel, Cisco, Intel, SAP,
Sun Microsystems and other companies founded the “IP for Smart Objects” (IPSO)
        
the “IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Area Networks” (6LoWPAN) working
group set up by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is addressing the problem
of supporting IPv6 using the 802.15.4 wireless communication standard

Towards realizing the broader vision of Internet of Things (IoT), various stan- dards \& protocols are emerging providing end-to-end internet connectivity between the resource constrained devices. IEEE 802.15.4 LoWPAN defines physical \& MAC layer standards while the IETF 6LoWPAN specifies network layer adaptation of IPv6 protocol to the LoWPAN networks. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is emerging as the open application layer protocol designed to support resource constrained machine-to- machine (M2M) application environment. CoAP supports basic HTTP methods enabling easy integration with the existing Web. In this paper, we present an approach to using CoAP for agriculture monitoring. We discuss the application requirements, soil sensor integration to Wireless Sensor Networks and how CoAP can be utilized for realtime soil property monitoring over the Web.},

abstract = {Mobile Ad Hoc NETworks (MANETs) are generally thought of as infrastructureless and largely “un-managed” network deployments, capable of accommodating highly dynamic network topologies. Yet, while the network infrastructure may be “un-managed”, monitoring the network performance and setting configuration parameters once deployed, remains important in order to ensure proper “tuning” and maintenance of a MANET. This paper describes a management framework for the MANET routing protocol OLSRv2, and its constituent protocol NHDP. It does so by presenting considerations for “what to monitor and manage” in an OLSRv2 network, and how. The approach developed is based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and thus this paper details the various Management Information Bases (MIBs) for router status monitoring and control - as well as a novel approach to history-based performance monitoring. While SNMP may not be optimally designed for MANETs, it is chosen due to it being the predominant protocol for IP network management - and thus, efforts are made in this paper to “adapt” the management tools within the SNMP framework for reasonable behavior also in a MANET environment.},

In this paper, we discuss these application requirements in detail. We also contend that the characteristics of passive RFID technology introduce constraints that are unique to the development of middleware for the RFID domain. These constraints include the occurrence of false negative reads, tag memory variations, the heterogeneous reader landscape, and the limited communication bandwidth available to RFID readers. To address these constraints and the application requirements for filtered and aggregated RFID data, we developed Accada, an open source RFID platform. This paper shows that the Accada implementation, which is based on a set of specifications developed by the EPCglobal community and a number of extensions, such as the surrogate concept and the virtual tag memory service, addresses the majority of the application requirements and limitations of passive RFID technology.},

abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

Sensor nodes can be imagined as small computers, extremely basic in termsof their interfaces and their components. They usually consist of a processing unit with limited computational power and limited memory, sensors (includ- ing specific conditioning circuitry), a communication device (usually radio transceivers or alternatively optical), and a power source usually in the form of a battery. Other possible inclusions are energy harvesting modules, sec- ondary ASICs, and possibly secondary communication devices (e.g., RS-232 or USB).

The future Internet is no longer a collection of links, routers, and protocols.It will be viewed as a network of applications, information, and contents. The
future Internet will become an architecture for participation by the users
and, eventually, for contribution of hardware resources. Hence, intelligent
edge-based applications and services will dominate the future Internet.
